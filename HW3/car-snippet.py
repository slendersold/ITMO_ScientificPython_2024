  Car class. 
  Has a class variable for counting total amount of cars on the road (increased by 1 upon instance initialization).

  Constructor params:
    max_speed: a maximum possible speed, km/h
    current_speed: current speed, km/h (0 by default)
    state: reflects if the Car is in the parking or on the road

  Methods:
    accelerate: increases the speed using IncreaseSpeed() iterator either once or gradually to the upper_border
    brake: decreases the speed using DecreaseSpeed() iterator either once or gradually to the lower_border
    parking: if the Car is not already in the parking, removes the Car from the road
    total_cars: show the total amount of cars on the road
    show_weather: shows the current weather conditions
